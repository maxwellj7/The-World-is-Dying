<p>Acording to Sciencing.com "When you drive by a refinery, the smell can be overwhelming. Factory pollution is often thought of as those mostly visible and smelly smokestack emissions. Industry pollutes the water and land around you as well. While you can't visibly see all pollutants, once they enter the atmosphere or the water system; they can spread far and wide beyond the factory. The most common factory air pollutants are greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. Factories contribute to water and land pollution by acidifying rain, chemical spills and disposal of toxic waste." This is the air we breath and the water that maybe sometimes we get in on a hot summer. This could be fix by replacing machines with human using less machines maybe so that we could also bring more jobs to the people that need it.
